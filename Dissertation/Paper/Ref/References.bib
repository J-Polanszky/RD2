	abstract = {Dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) is a method of automatically modifying a game’s features, behaviors, and scenarios in real-time, depending on the player’s skill, so that the player, when the game is very simple, does not feel bored or frustrated, when it is very difficult. The intent of the DDA is to keep the player engrossed till the end and to provide him/her with a challenging experience. In traditional games, difficulty levels increase linearly or stepwise during the course of the game. The features such as frequency, starting levels, or rates can be set only at the beginning of the game by choosing a level of difficulty. This can, however, result in a negative experience for players as they try to map a predecided learning curve. DDA attempts to solve this problem by presenting a customized solution for the gamers. This paper provides a review of the current approaches to DDA.},

Traditional games with fixed difficulty levels often fail to cater to the diverse preferences and skills of players. To address these needs, dynamic difficulty adjustment (DDA) has emerged as a crucial element in game design. This review explores the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) in achieving DDA, contrasting it with traditional methods. By examining various DRL algorithms and their effectiveness, as well as evaluating traditional models, this review identifies the potential of DRL in enhancing player experiences and outlines existing challenges. It also highlights future research directions, including the integration of DRL with Flow Theory and innovative evaluation methods. The goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of how DRL can advance game design and improve player satisfaction.},

Being part of this industry means competing against lots of other companies and developers, thus, making fanbases of vital importance. They are a group of clients that constantly support your company because your video games are fun. Videogames are most entertaining when the difficulty level is a good match for the player's skill, increasing the player engagement. However, not all players are equally proficient, so some kind of difficulty selection is required. In this paper, we will present Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA), a recently arising research topic, which aims to develop an automated difficulty selection mechanism that keeps the player engaged and properly challenged, neither bored nor overwhelmed. We will present some recent research addressing this issue, as well as an overview of how to implement it. Satisfactorily solving the DDA problem directly affects the player's experience when playing the game, making it of high interest to any game developer, from independent ones, to 100 billion dollar businesses, because of the potential impacts in player retention and monetization.},

            An educational game aims to employ the pleasant and fascinating environment of a game for educational purpose. However, when the game’s educational content or playing environment does not match with the player’s learning needs or game-playing skills, the player can find the game either too easy or too difficult and decide to drop it. Therefore, a successful educational game has to offer Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) of both the game’s educational content and the game’s playing environment. Considering the above, in this paper a fuzzy-based DDA mechanism of a 3D-game, that teaches the programming language ‘HTML’, is presented. The game adapts dynamically the difficulty of battles and mazes navigation to each individual player’s skills. The novelty of the presented game lies on the application of DDA in the two dimensions (educational content and playing environment) of an educational game and on the use of fuzzy logic for succeeding balance between the game’s difficulty and the user’s playing skills. The adaptation is realized in real-time, during the playing and not each time the player changes game level/track. Furthermore, fuzzy logic allows to apply DDA without the need of many learning data, like other Artificial Intelligence techniques for DDA (i.e. machine learning techniques). The presented game was evaluated through a comparative evaluation, which included questionnaires, an experiment in real conditions and t-test statistical analysis method. The evaluation results showed that the incorporated adaptation mechanism increases the user’s motivation and succeeds to keep players’ interest for the game undiminished.},

Its links to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been outlined in the past; however, the use of RL techniques within tree search has not been thoroughly studied yet. In this paper we re-examine in depth this close relation between the two fields; our goal is to improve the cross-awareness between the two communities. We show that a straightforward adaptation of RL semantics within tree search can lead to a wealth of new algorithms, for which the traditional MCTS is only one of the variants. We confirm that planning methods inspired by RL in conjunction with online search demonstrate encouraging results on several classic board games and in arcade video game competitions, where our algorithm recently ranked first. Our study promotes a unified view of learning, planning, and search.},

	abstract = {General Video Game Playing (GVGP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence where agents play a variety of real-time video games that are unknown in advance. This limits the use of domain-specific heuristics. Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a search technique for game playing that does not rely on domain-specific knowledge. This paper discusses eight enhancements for MCTS in GVGP; Progressive History, N-Gram Selection Technique, Tree Reuse, Breadth-First Tree Initialization, Loss Avoidance, Novelty-Based Pruning, Knowledge-Based Evaluations, and Deterministic Game Detection. Some of these are known from existing literature, and are either extended or introduced in the context of GVGP, and some are novel enhancements for MCTS. Most enhancements are shown to provide statistically significant increases in win percentages when applied individually. When combined, they increase the average win percentage over sixty different games from 31.0\% to 48.4\% in comparison to a vanilla MCTS implementation, approaching a level that is competitive with the best agents of the GVG-AI competition in 2015.},
